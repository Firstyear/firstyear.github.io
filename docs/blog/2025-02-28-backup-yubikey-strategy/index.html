        <h1>Backup Yubikey Strategy</h1>

        <p>After a local security meetup where I presented about Webauthn, I had a really interesting
chat with a member about a possible Yubikey management strategy.</p>
<p>Normally when you purchase a yubikey it's recommended that you buy two of them - one primary
and one backup. But how do you keep them in sync? You have to ensure every key you enroll
on the primary is also on the backup!</p>
<p>This means you tend to have your secondary key nearby - not so great for backups/disaster
management.</p>
<p>When we start to look at a business, they'll want to consider something a bit more robust
like a '3 2 1' esque strategy (3 copies, 2 different physical media, 1 copy off site).</p>
<p>Given these are yubikeys, we can't really do the 2 different physical media (especially as
no other key maker even comes close to yubikeys quality and security). But we can consider
the 3 and 1 parts.</p>
<p>We can easily have 3 yubikeys and 1 offsite. But now the maintenance of keeping all these
updated is much harder. How do we take care of this?</p>
<p>Rotate the keys - on a schedule, the keys should be swapped in place (similar to industrial
pumps with lead, lag, and reserve). We have a lead key that's used daily, the lag key which
is the backup onsite, and the reserve which is offsite. Then we periodically rotate them
so that the lead becomes the lag, the lag becomes the reserve (and offsite), and the reserve
is moved onsite as the lead key. This allows the lead key (former reserve key) to quickly be
identified for missing any credentials, and the lag key can be used to authorise the lead
key to enroll anything that it was missing.</p>
<p>I don't think this process is perfect - there is obviously a delay between a new account enrollment
and it being on all three keys. This delay is going to be based on the rotation period. There is
still also a risk that infrequently used accounts may be missed on one of the three keys, which
can require some discipline to ensure that all credentials are periodically tested and verified
as operational.</p>
<p>I think this is a really interesting suggestion and has some promise, but I'd be keen to hear of
other thoughts on the matter - or better ways to manage this. I certainly don't think this approach
is for everyone either, but I can see a lot of places it would be quite valuable.</p>
